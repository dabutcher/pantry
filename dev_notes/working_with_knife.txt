Helps to have knife installed for managing cookbooks.

In particular, "knife cookbook site ..." helps get community cookbooks
installed with all dependencies.  Of note, I've found it needs to be given
an absolute path to the cookbook location.

$ knife cookbook site install -o /path/to/my-pantry/cookbooks some-cookbook

That also needs to be in a git repo, which shouldn't be an issue.

Q: Should pantry encapsulate this (if knife is available)?
