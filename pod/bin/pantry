=head1 SYNOPSIS

N.B. This program doesn't do much yet, but I'll expand this synopses
incrementally as features are added

  $ mkdir my-project
  $ cd my-project
  $ pantry init
  $ pantry create node foo.example.com
  $ pantry edit node foo.example.com

=head1 SEE ALSO

Inspiration for this tool came from similar chef-solo management tools.
In addition to being implemented in different languages, each approaches
the problem in slightly different ways, neither of which fit my priorities.
Nevertheless, if you use chef-solo, you might consider them as well:

=for :list
* L<littlechef|https://github.com/tobami/littlechef> (Python)
* L<pocketknife|https://github.com/igal/pocketknife> (Ruby)
