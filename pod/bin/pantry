=head1 SYNOPSIS

N.B. This program doesn't do much yet, but I'll expand this synopses
incrementally as features are added

  $ mkdir my-project
  $ cd my-project
  $ pantry init
  $ pantry create node foo.example.com
  $ pantry edit node foo.example.com
  $ pantry sync node foo.example.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pantry> is a utility to make it easier to manage a collection of
computers with the configuration management tool
L<chef-solo|http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo>

=head1 USAGE

(To be written...)

=head1 AUTHENTICATION

C<pantry> relies on OpenSSH for secure communications with managed nodes,
but does not manage keys itself.  Instead, it expects the user to manage
keys using standard OpenSSH configuration and tools.

The user should specify SSH private keys to use in the ssh config file.  One
approach would be to use the C<IdentityFile> with a host-name wildcard:

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/identities/id_dsa_%h

This would allow a directory of host-specific identities (which could all be
symlinks to a master key).  Another alternative might be to create a master key
for each environment:

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_dev
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_test
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_prod

C<pantry> also assumes that the user will unlock keys using C<ssh-agent>.
For example, assuming that ssh-agent has not already been invoked by a
graphical shell session, it can be started with a subshell of a terminal:

  $ ssh-agent $SHELL

Then private keys can be unlocked in advance of running C<pantry> using
C<ssh-add>:

  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa_test
  $ pantry ...

See the documentation for C<ssh-add> for control over how long keys
stay unlocked.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Inspiration for this tool came from similar chef-solo management tools.
In addition to being implemented in different languages, each approaches
the problem in slightly different ways, neither of which fit my priorities.
Nevertheless, if you use chef-solo, you might consider them as well:
